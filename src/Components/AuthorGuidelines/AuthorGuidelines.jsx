                    <br /><b>Important IEEE Policy Announcement*</b><br />
                    <p>Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE will take action against any author who has engaged in either practice.</p>

                    <br /><br /><b>Accessing the templates:</b><br />

                    <br /><br /><p>To be published in the ViTECoN 2023 Conference Proceedings and IEEE Xplore, the author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the FULL or LIMITED (member or non-member) rate. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. Accepted papers will be published in the ViTECoN 2023 Conference Proceedings.</p>
                    
                    <br /><br /><b>Final Paper Guidelines:</b><br />
                    The final paper should be written in English with a maximum paper length of six printed pages including figures.
